# Introduction

The increase in the world population and the emergence of various epidemic diseases have affected people around the world. People can die for many reasons. We can list the causes such as climate change, wars, diseases, increasing population and the use of harmful substances. That's why I wanted to investigate why death rates around the world are increasing and why people die. I want to know if the deaths are concentrated in a certain region or there is an increase in deaths worldwide. Because one of the most fundamental rights that people have in the world is the right to live, and therefore it will be beneficial for humanity to focus on this situation. In this way, people can be made aware of this situation and various measures can be taken around the world to reduce the death rate increase.
